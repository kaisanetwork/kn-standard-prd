# Discovery Question Bank

Use these questions selectively. Ask only what is missing.

## Core (always cover)

1. What user/business problem are we solving right now?
2. Who is the primary user and what job are they trying to complete?
3. What metric must move to call this successful?
4. What are the top constraints (time, budget, platform, compliance)?
5. What is explicitly out of scope?

## Product and UX

1. What are the top 1-3 user journeys this feature must support?
2. Which edge cases or failure states matter most?
3. Are there design system or accessibility constraints we must enforce?

## Technical

1. Which systems/services does this depend on?
2. Any security/privacy requirements (PII, SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)?
3. What performance SLOs are required (latency, throughput, availability)?

## AI Feature Add-on

1. What model/provider assumptions are acceptable?
2. How will output quality be evaluated (dataset, rubric, target pass rate)?
3. What is fallback behavior when confidence is low?
4. What guardrails are required (safety, privacy, hallucination limits)?

## Prioritization and Rollout

1. What is MVP vs post-MVP?
2. Any hard deadline or launch window?
3. Which stakeholder must sign off before build starts?
